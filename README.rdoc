== King of the HFT (Server)

Codeship Status for {supernova32/KingServer}[https://www.codeship.io/projects/3676] https://www.codeship.io/projects/699d7820-a4fa-0130-bef1-0a95370ae88f/status?branch=master

Rails Powered Server to manage the user and rooms database, provide a nice WebUI and forward data to an Android App.
The purpose of this server is to be the central command for a King of the Hill based game.
Students of the Hochschule f√ºr Technik Stuttgart will use the Android App in conjuction with this server to
check in to hidden places inside the campus. (First version. We plan to expand this to a global scale after the
first beta tests)

== Beta phase

Once a majority of students of the same course of studies check into that location, that location becomes theirs.
Once the majority of locations in the vecinity of a building belong to a single course, the building becomes theirs.
The game ends when one of the courses has control of 70% of all the buildings, or after a given time with the winning
team being the one that has the most locations claimed.

The location of the hidden areas can change randomly.

== Getting Started

* Create an account with our server (URL to be determined)
* Download the KingApp
* Login in inside the app and start looking for the hidden locations
